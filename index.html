<p>Websites are so fun to create and design!</p>
<p><span>It requires 3 coding languages! Javascript, HTML, and CSS<br>
    the main language is HTML, but you can add CSS into your webpage to style it, using the tag style as shown here:<br>
    <style></style><br>
    Javascript (AKA JS) makes your page interactive. To insert it into HTML use the tag script as shown:<br>
    <span id = "script"><script></script></span><br> 
    I cannot add the tags because it reads them as literal code not words</span></p>
<script>
var headingEl = document.querySelector("script");
    script.textContent = "<script></script>";
    }
</script>

    </body>
